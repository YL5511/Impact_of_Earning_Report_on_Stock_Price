# Impact_of_Earning_Report_on_Stock_Price
•	Use liburl to retrieve historical price data from Yahoo Finance: A function retrieves the adjusted close prices for selected Russell 1000 stocks and iShares Russell 100
(IWB) into memory.
•	Parse the retrieved prices and store them in STL vector for each stock and IWB.
•	Create a set of classes such as class for stock to handle EPS Estimate and price information.
•	Use member functions or independent functions for all calculation. Overload a few arithmetic operators for vector/matrix.
•	The stocks and their corresponding price information for each group should be stored in a STL map, with stock symbol as its keys.
•	The AAR and CAAR for 3 groups are presented in a matrix. The row of the matrix is the group#, matrix columns are for AAR and CAAR.
•	Use Excel Driver (strongly suggested, but gnuplot could be an alternative for Apple computers) to show the CAAR from all 3 groups in one graph.
